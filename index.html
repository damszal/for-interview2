        <h1>The Raven </h1>
        <h2>By Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
        <p class="par-1">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br>
          Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
          While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
          As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
          “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
          Only this and nothing more.”
        </p>
        <p class="par-2">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
          And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
          Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
          From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
          For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
          Nameless here for evermore.

          And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <br>
          Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
          So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
          “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
          Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>
          This it is and nothing more.”

          Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
          “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
          But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
          And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
          That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>
          Darkness there and nothing more.
